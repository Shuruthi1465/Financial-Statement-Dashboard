# Financial-Statement-Dashboard
This project involves building an interactive Financial Statement Dashboard using Power BI, based on Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L) and Balance Sheet data. The goal is to provide key financial insights such as revenue trends, profit margins, assets vs. liabilities, and important financial ratios â€” all through visually rich and dynamic dashboards.
